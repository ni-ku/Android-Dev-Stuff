This is a collection of things i use more or less frequently for android development.

# Templates
Its annoying to create several files for a single View.
These themplates let you create a set of files with a single click that match your 
architecture.
They make you happy ;)

## How to use
Copy the folders to\
<AndroidStudioRoot>/plugins/android/lib/templates/other\  
  
## Notes
When updating Android-Studio it will complain about those files, so its better
to remove them before executing the update.
